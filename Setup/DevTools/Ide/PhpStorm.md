PhpStorm is not free unless you have an open source or student license. 
It is however very mature and comes well recommended.

## Configuration
Setup your PhpStorm configuration or install [Webber's configuration ðŸ——](https://github.com/webbertakken/PHPStormSettings)

of languages surrounding these.
